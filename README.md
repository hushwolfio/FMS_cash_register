# FMS Code Challenge: Cash Register

# Languages/Frameworks used:
Vite Project with TypeScript, React, and Mantine for reusable component library, and Vitest for the testing.

# Purpose
The challenge was to create a cash register that allowed you to add/remove in money in the denominations of $(1, 2, 5, 10, 20) then you could see what specific denominations there were in the cash register.  On top of this, you could dispense a specific amount and it will remove denominations descending from $20 and below.  If it's unable to do so, it will inform you it's unable to, otherwise, it will inform you of the specific denominations it has dispensed.
